# 🔐 Encrypted Password Vault – Python Project 

## 💡 Overview
The **Encrypted Password Vault** is a secure, terminal-based password manager that allows you to **store, view, and encrypt passwords** locally on your system.  
It uses strong AES encryption (via Python’s `cryptography` library) to ensure your credentials remain safe and unreadable to anyone without your encryption key.  

This project demonstrates **practical cybersecurity concepts** such as data encryption, key management, and secure storage — all implemented with clean, simple Python code.
